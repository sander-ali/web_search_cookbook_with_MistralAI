One of the persistent challenges in chatbots and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is their propensity to fabricate sources or misformat URLs, undermining the reliability of their outputs. Mistral's cutting-edge capabilities overcome these limitations, ensuring precise and trustworthy information retrieval.
